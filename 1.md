## Validating Compliance with terms of Oracle Licenses

I have executed Oracle's "WebLogic Server Basic License Feature Usage Measurement Script (Doc ID 885587.1)" against the Weblogic deployments on the following Servers:

* mer-esofr-prod-01 (Forms & Report)
* dc2-esimg-prod-02 (WebCenter Content - Imaging)
* dc2-esetn-prod-02 (WebCenter Content - Efulfilment)

_I don't presently have access to either mer-esitn-prod-01 or dc2-esitn-prod-02 (Eserve) and have raised PD-2084 (request for access)_

 

*Kindly review the reports below to establish conformance.*

Feature usage measurement error:  Application Oracle Universal Content Management - Content Server uses a non-default deployment order:  225
You can change the deployment order for a deployed application or stand-alone module by setting the AppDeploymentMBean DeploymentOrder attribute in the Administration Console (or programmatically using the AppDeploymentMBean). The DeploymentOrder attribute controls the load order of deployments relative to one another - modules with lower DeploymentOrder values deploy before those with higher values. By default, each deployment unit is configured with a DeploymentOrder value of 100. Deployments with the same DeploymentOrder value are deployed in alphabetical order using the deployment name. In all cases, applications and stand-alone modules are deployed after the WebLogic Server instance has initialized dependent subsystems.
In the license for WebLogic Server Basic, deploying an application or module with a non-default deployment order setting is not permitted.
